On this site I will cover doumentation and guides for a a variety of topics such as home automation and data engineering.

Please use these docs to help grow your knowledge or implement some ideas.

I built this site with mkdocs. It was very quick and simple if you'd like to build something similar then please check out their documentation. [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/).
